understanding the work before jumping straight in


firstly, what is a file descriptor

a file descriptor is an index into the file descriptor table,  what does that mean?

so within our O.S. we have something called the PCB which is the process control block of our computer or we could refer to it as the tast controlling block

now the pcb has something called the file descriptor table within it and the F.D.T. holds pointers to resources such as files , input and output to the terminal and so fourth.

so back to fd's

say for example i wanted to create a file, id do something like this

	fd = create("Myfile.txt", (specific permission that you wanna give) );

now when i wanna do something like read from that file i can then use my fd as a handle to the file ive then created 

you can do other cool stuff like write since the first parameter of write takes in a file descriptor


now reading from a file descriptor is like thinking of a book , you first need to open the book before you read it dont you?
then when you done you must remember to close the book

the next thing we need to understand is static variables, so why we use a static variable in our gnl is because static variables keep their valued unlike normal variables so if we think of why we would use a static variable in our gnl is because we need to call our gnl in a lop if we want it to read until there is nothing left to read, because its called in a loop then our gnl needs to remember where it last left off then it can continue reading, hence the use of a static variable in our get next line

from there we need to understand how to read from the file descriptor, this is were one of our helpful sys calls come in which is read, read takes in a file descriptor , a void pointer and the size you tell it to read, almost like how write you tell it how much tp write out, now with read you tell it to read a specific ammount 


then we need to understand what a buffer is
