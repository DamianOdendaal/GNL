What is GNL (Get_next_line)?

GNL is a function that reads a file line by line, 

What is the goal of GNL?

The goal is to create a function that is able to read from the file descriptor while we are allowed to use only 3 functions that are not part of our libft, these functions are Read() , Malloc(), free(). This makes the project a whole lot more difficult, The project also focuses on memory management, teaching us the importance of freeing memory after you have finished using it
